About Dataset

This dataset, provides realistic signal metrics for 3G, 4G, 5G, and LTE network analysis using DragonOS, Spike, and SDR devices. The dataset aims to provide a representative sample of signal measurements for various network types and locations in Bihar, India. The dataset also replicates the hardware setup involving the Spike software, DragonOS running on the Valve Steam Deck gaming system, BB60C spectrum analyzer powered by an external USB3 hub connected to the Steam Deck's USB C port, srsRan running on a separate laptop for creating the base station using the bladeRFxA9 device.

Features:
The dataset includes the following features:

    Timestamp: The timestamps represent the time at which the signal metrics were recorded, with a 10-minute interval between each timestamp.

    Latitude and Longitude: The latitude and longitude coordinates indicate the location of the measurement in Bihar. The dataset covers 20 specified localities in Bihar, including Kankarbagh, Rajendra Nagar, Boring Road, Ashok Rajpath, Danapur, Anandpuri, Bailey Road, Gardanibagh, Patliputra Colony, Phulwari Sharif, Exhibition Road, Pataliputra, Fraser Road, Kidwaipuri, Gandhi Maidan, S.K. Puri, Anisabad, Boring Canal Road, Bankipore, and Kumhrar.

    Signal Strength (dBm): The signal strength represents the received signal power in decibels (dBm) for different network types (3G, 4G, 5G, and LTE).

    Signal Quality (%): The signal quality represents the percentage of signal strength relative to the maximum possible signal strength. It is calculated based on the signal strength values and is applicable for 3G, 4G, 5G, and LTE networks. Unfortunately, Signal Quality percentage yielded some error so it's 0.0 in all.

    Data Throughput (Mbps): The data throughput represents the network's capacity to transmit data, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Different network types have varying data throughput values.

    Latency (ms): Latency refers to the time delay between the transmission and reception of data packets, measured in milliseconds (ms). Different network types have different latency values, generated using a random uniform distribution within appropriate ranges.

    Network Type: The network type indicates the technology used for data transmission, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, or LTE.

    BB60C Measurement (dBm): The BB60C measurement represents the signal strength measured using the BB60C spectrum analyzer device. The values are generated based on the signal strength values with added random uniform noise specific to 4G, 5G, and LTE networks.

    srsRAN Measurement (dBm): The srsRAN measurement represents the signal strength measured using the srsRAN software-defined radio device.

    BladeRFxA9 Measurement (dBm): The BladeRFxA9 measurement represents the signal strength measured using the BladeRFxA9 software-defined radio device.

The dataset is generated with a total of 1926 time periods and covers 20 localities in Bihar. It can be used for various purposes, including network optimization, coverage analysis, and performance evaluation.

Hardware Setup:
The dataset replicates the hardware setup using the following components:

    Valve Steam Deck gaming system running DragonOS Focal
    BB60C spectrum analyzer powered by an external USB3 hub
    srsRan software-defined radio (SDR) device
    BladeRFxA9 software-defined radio (SDR) device

The BB60C spectrum analyzer is connected to the Steam Deck's USB C port via an external USB3 hub. The srsRan and BladeRFxA9 devices are connected to a separate laptop, which is running the srsenb software to create the base station.

Additionally, the Spike LTE Analysis tools are utilized to decode the LTE information in real-time. The dataset demonstrates how the Spike software, DragonOS, and SDR devices can be integrated to perform LTE analysis, and the results can be combined with a working GPS for mapping purposes within the Spike software.

Atlast, We'd like to extend credits to our volunteers in these localities who helped in logging the data after replicating the setup.

Let us know what you build out of this dataset. It's a subset of data that's being analysed for bio weapon usage in the Bihar area which's controlled via wireless signals to report to international delegates for expedited action against these.
